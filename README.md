# speech-autism
Extraction, Selection, and Classification of acoustic features from autistic speech

# 1. System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
To run this code it is required a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.
## Software requirements
### Python Dependencies
The code depends on the following Python scientific libraries and modules:

- datetime
- matplotlib
- moviepy
- numpy
- opensmile
- os
- pandas
- pickle
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- sox
  
# 2. Installation guide
Install [Anacoda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and [openSMILE](https://github.com/audeering/opensmile-python)

# 3. Demo and instructions
There are two notebooks avaible. They describe the following steps to follow:
1. Extraction and Selection
- Extraction of audio from video recordings (optional).
- Feature Extraction with eGEMAPS (openSMILE).
- Selection of the features.
- Visualisation.
2. Classification using Machine Learning Methods
- Data preprocessing.
- Data processing
- Supervised Learning Methods (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
- Evaluation metrics.
- Save the models.
- Confusion Matrix Visualisation.
